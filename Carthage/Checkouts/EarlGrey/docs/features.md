# Features
EarlGrey offers features that make testing your app easier and more effective.


## Synchronization

Typically, you shouldnâ€™t be concerned about synchronization as EarlGrey automatically synchronizes with the
UI, network requests, main [Dispatch Queue](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html),
and the main [NSOperationQueue](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperationQueue_class/).
To support cases where you want to wait for some event to occur before the next UI interaction happens,
EarlGrey provides Synchronization APIs that allow you to control EarlGrey's synchronization behavior. You can
use these APIs to increase the stability of your tests.

## Visibility Checks<a name="visibility-checks"></a>

EarlGrey uses screenshot differential comparison (also known as 'screenshot diffs') to determine the
visibility of UI elements before interacting with them. As a result, you can be certain that a user can see
and interact with the UI that EarlGrey interacts with.

Note: Out-of-process (i.e. system generated) alert views and other modal dialogs that obscure the UI can
interfere with this process.

## User-Like Interaction

Taps and swipes are performed using app-level touch events, instead of using element-level event handlers.
Before every UI interaction, EarlGrey asserts that the elements being interacted with are actually visible
(see [Visibility Checks](#visibility-checks)) and not just present in the view hierarchy. EarlGrey's UI
interactions simulate how a real user would interact with your app's UI, and help you to find and fix the
same bugs that users would encounter in your app.
